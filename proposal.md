# Community Software Analysis Proposal
Please edit this file and push to your repository.

## Software: *FiPy*

This is a finite-volume PDE solver for Python. It is maintained by the Materials Science and Engineering Division (MSED) and Center for Theoretical and Computational Materials Science (CTCMS) in the Material Measurement Laboratory (MML) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

### Notes/concerns/risks

I'm a little concerned that the repository is not active enough. Although it seems like 
several people who aren't affiliated with NIST have contributed over the years, the most 
recent commits have all been from folks affiliated with the MML. However, issues are 
well documented and there is a mailing list/ other information about how to contribute 
to the project.
